Thoughts to flesh out later:
- data comes before identification in modules because it's more commonly a required field since more than one type of identification is typical
- With deprecated assets like peripherals and managed preferences the get, update, and delete endpoints will be added but not creation since you shouldn't be making these anymore but you may still want to have access to disable or delete them since they're not in the GUI anymore
